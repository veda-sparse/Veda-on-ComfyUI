    ComfyUI only leaves its default `cpu_state = CPUState.GPU` when `--cpu`

    torch build matches neither, so `get_torch_device()` falls through to
    `torch.cuda.current_device()` and raises "Torch not compiled with CUDA
    enabled" - which is what CI's Linux and Windows runners hit. Setting
    the flag before anything imports `model_management` also makes the
    three CI platforms agree: without it macOS runs these tests against
    MPS and probes the mlx backend, and Linux does not.
